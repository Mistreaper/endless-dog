# endless-dog
oh-my-zsh theme
Original link: [https://github.com/qwelyt/endless-dog](https://github.com/qwelyt/endless-dog)

## What?
A fork from their theme. I modified it because there's an `svn` error, even if `svn` is installed. This is just a `zsh-theme` that looks like the `grml` theme.

## Dependencies:
Of course you need `git` and `zsh`. Also you need `oh-my-zsh`

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## How to install?

Run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Mistreaper/endless-dog
```
and of course move it:
```
cd endless-dog && mv endless-dog.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes
```
and edit `~/.zshrc`:
```
ZSH_THEME="endless-dog"
```

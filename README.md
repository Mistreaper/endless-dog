oh-my-zsh theme

## What?
I've been using grml-zsh-config since the day I started using zsh all those many years ago. 
grml comes with a *great* config in my opinion. It does however have a serious problem: Speed.

On some of my machines, it takes roughly 4 seconds to get a shell. Now, as all shell-users know, you use the shell because you want to get things done quickly. If I have to wait 4 seconds just to be able to do something, it's wrong.
So I decided to try out oh-my-zsh. Going from grml, this is blazingly fast. I get a shell up in less than a second. But grml has such a nice theme. So I missed that. And what do you do when you miss it? Fork fork fork!
This isn't really a fork though. It's more of a clone. I have blatantly copied the looks of the theme and put it into a OMZ-theme. Seems to work. Also did *very* minor changes. Like yellow when branch is dirty.

## Plugins
You'll need the `git` and `svn` plugins for this theme to be happy.
